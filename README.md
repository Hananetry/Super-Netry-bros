Super Netry Bros is a retro-style platformer video game made in Python using Tkinter! You control Netry, a mascot that looks like a "no entry" traffic sign, through a series of classic platform levels. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible while dodging enemies. You have 3 lives to complete each world.
